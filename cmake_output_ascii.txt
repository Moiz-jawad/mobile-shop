(cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with 
CMake < 3.5 has been 
removed from CMake.

  Update the VERSION 
argument <min> value.  
Or, use the <min>...<max> 
syntax
  to tell CMake that the 
project requires at least 
<min> but has been updated
  to work with policies 
introduced by <max> or 
earlier.

  Or, add -DCMAKE_POLICY_V
ERSION_MINIMUM=3.5 to try 
configuring anyway.
